# Computer-Graphics-project
A computer graphics project related to environment and sunrise/sunset could involve creating a realistic 3D simulation of a natural environment, such as a beach or a mountain range, and depicting the changes in lighting and atmosphere that occur during sunrise and sunset.
Overall, a computer graphics project related to environment and sunrise/sunset could be a visually stunning and technically challenging project that involves creating a realistic 3D simulation of a natural environment and depicting the changes in lighting and atmosphere that occur during sunrise and sunset. It would require a combination of 3D modeling, rendering, and animation skills, as well as an understanding of the physics of light and atmosphere.
